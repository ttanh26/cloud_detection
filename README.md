Shallow clouds play a huge role in determining the Earth's climate. Theyâ€™re also difficult to understand and to represent in climate models. By classifying different types of cloud organization, researchers at Max Planck hope to improve our physical understanding of these clouds, which in turn will help us build better climate models.
